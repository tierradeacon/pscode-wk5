// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd


(Check if a number is divisible by 2 until the remainder is 0. 
If yes print Even. 
If no print Odd.)

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


(X = A Numeric Value 
Read X-X-X-X-X and print
1,2,3,4,5
'Find the Average' Add 1,2,3,4,5 and divide by 5 
Find the minimum 'Is the Minimum'
Find the maximum 'Is the Maximum'
Print all results )
